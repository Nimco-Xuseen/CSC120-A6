- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance has made my code more organized and reusable by letting me define shared attributes and methods once in the Building class, then use them in subclasses like House, Library, and Cafe. It really streamlined my code, but I learned to be careful about calling super(...) in constructors and managing access levels.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
For anyone taking this course in the future, I’d suggest getting comfortable with the super keyword and practicing with small class activities—it really helps with understanding how inheritance improves code structure and readability.
